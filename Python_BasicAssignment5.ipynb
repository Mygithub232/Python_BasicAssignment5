    "    They maintain their ordering unless explicitly re-ordered (for example, by sorting the list).\n",
    "    They can be of any type, and types can be mixed.\n",

    "--> Use pprint() to Pretty Print a Dictionary in Python\n",
    "    This module also supports pretty-printing dictionary. \n",
    "    Within the pprint module there is a function with the same name pprint() , which is the function used to pretty-print the given string or object.\n"
